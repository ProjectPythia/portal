# Pythia Portal contributor's guide

This document contains information specific to contributing to the
Project Pythia Portal. Please first refer to [Pythia Contributor's
Guide](https://projectpythia.org/pages/contributing.html) for overall
contribution guidelines (such as detailed description of Project
Pythia structure, forking, repository cloning, branching, etc.).

## Instructions for building the portal site

The portal site is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

When testing new content it is important to build and view the site. Read the Docs automatically builds the site for you when each Pull Request is checked. However, you can also build it locally on your machine following the instructions
below.

### Building the site

After checking out a local copy of the site, in your favorite terminal, navigate to the `portal` directory of the source repository

```bash
cd projectpythia.github.io/portal
```

Use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) to set up a build environment:

```bash
conda env update -f ../ci/environment.yml
```

This will create or update the dev environment (`pythia`).

#### Install `pre-commit` hooks

This repository includes `pre-commit` hooks (defined in
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`). To activate/install these pre-commit
hooks, run:

```bash
conda activate pythia
pre-commit install
```

Setting up the environment is typically a one-time step.

_NOTE_: The `pre-commit` package is already installed via the `pythia` conda environment.

#### Building the book locally

Build the site locally using Sphinx (which you just installed in the `pythia` environment, along with all necessary dependencies):

```bash
make html
```

The newly rendered site is now available in `portal/_build/html/index.html`.
Open with your web browser, or from the terminal:

```bash
open _build/html/index.html
```

However, many of the links will not work. For all of the links
found in the portal to work properly, you'll need to set up a local
testing server. This can be done with Python's http.server by running
the following command from within the `portal` directory:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory _build/html/
```

and then pointing your browser at the URL: localhost:8000.

More information on setting up a local test server is available from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)

When you're done, you can deactivate the dedicated build environment with

```bash
conda deactivate
```

You can re-activate the `pythia` conda environment at any time with `conda activate pythia`.

### To view the Read the Docs autobuild

Once a Pull Request has passed all tests, including the Read the Docs build, you can click "Details" of the check that says, "docs/readthedocs.org:projectpythia - Read the Docs build succeeded!" to launch a new tab with a build of the Project Pythia site. (You may have to click "Show all checks" for this to be displayed.)
